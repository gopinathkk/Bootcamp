    Tim Bergling (Swedish: [ˈtɪmː ˈbæ̂rjlɪŋ] (audio speaker iconlisten); 8 September 1989 – 20 April 2018), <br/> 
    known professionally as Avicii (/əˈviːtʃi/, Swedish: [aˈvɪ̌tːɕɪ]), was a Swedish DJ, remixer, record producer, 
    musician and songwriter. At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, 
    which led to his first record deal.[2] He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut 
    studio album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally s
    positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped international charts;
     the lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States

      "Hey Brother", "Addicted to You", "The Days", "The Nights", "Waiting for Love", "Without You" 
      and "Lonely Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta
       in 2012 and "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic 
       music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s
